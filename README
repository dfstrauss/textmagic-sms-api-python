PyTextMagicSMS 0.1a4
====================

This module provides a convenient interface to the TextMagic HTTPS API to send
SMS messages.

To use the service, you need to create an account at http://www.textmagic.com/
to get a username. Once you are registered, you can retrieve your API password
from https://www.textmagic.com/app/wt/account/api/cmd/password

The TextMagic HTTPS API is described at http://api.textmagic.com/https-api

An instance of the class textmagic.client.TextMagicClient must be instantiated
with your TextMagic username and password. API commands are implemented as
methods on this class. Currently implemented commands are:
    send
    account
    message_status
    receive
    delete_reply
Outstanding functionality (coming soon) is:
    send_time parameter for send command
    check_number command

Getting started
===============

To send a message:
    client = textmagic.client.TextMagicClient('username', 'password')
    result = client.send("A test message", "9991234444")
    message_id = result['message_id'].keys()[0]

Use the message_id to get the delivery status of your message:
    response = client.message_status(message_id)
    status = response[message_id]['status']

You can receive reply messages from your TextMagic Inbox:
    response = client.receive("0")
    for message in response['messages']:
        from_number = message['from']
        text = message['text']
